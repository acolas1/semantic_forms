Here is `semantic_forms`' description with this vocabulary:

All tools below could/should be described this way.

# Open source
## Web frameworks

- [cubicweb](http://www.cubicweb.org) is a semantic web framework written in Python. It can be used to develop applications that serve content both to humans and computers, providing each with the format it asks for.
- [Vivo / Vitro](http://vitro.mannlib.cornell.edu/) is a Java framework, geared towards academic research teams
- [Nemrod](https://github.com/conjecto/nemrod) is a PHP framework extending Symphony2
- [Apache Marmotta](http://marmotta.apache.org/) is more an infrastructure than a framework; seems to provide LDP and SPARQL , but not connected together
- [Apache Stanbol](https://stanbol.apache.org/overview.html) is geared towards Java CMS API standard [Java CMS API standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_repository_API_for_Java)
- [Coeus](http://bioinformatics.ua.pt/coeus/documentation/#tutorials)
- [The Open Semantic Framework (OSF)](http://opensemanticframework.org/) is an integrated software stack using semantic technologies for knowledge management. It has a layered architecture that combines existing open source software with additional open source components. 
- [Callimachus](http://callimachusproject.org/)  is a Java framework; does not seem to leverage and infer UI from ontologies 
- [Semantic_MediaWiki](https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Semantic_MediaWiki) a plugin to Wikipedia's MediaWiki
- Web Protégé forms: http://protegewiki.stanford.edu/wiki/PropertyFormPortlet#Examples ; alas one has to edit XML for portlet technology to create forms; apparently based on MongoDB, not SPARQL : https://github.com/protegeproject/webprotege/blob/master/pom.xml

- https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Knora
- [Corese](http://wimmics.inria.fr/corese) a serious infrastructure project, with SPARQL extensions, from french INRIA research institute. It's not clear what facilities it has for building applications.

## LOD navigation and / or edition
- https://ods-qa.openlinksw.com/rdf-editor/ : interesting tool ; compared to semantic_fors , the cursor is all the towards RDF experts , wheares SF has much the same flexibility, but the cursor is far in the direction of ordinary users
- tabulator , web browser plugin initiated by Tim BL https://github.com/linkeddata/tabulator

# Semi-Open source
- Virtuoso, powers dbpedia.org; semi-SQL and RDF

# Commercial
- Odase, a nice OWL, SWRL and SPARQL based Information System framework developped in Mercury
- http://factforge.net/ , a bit like Virtuoso; it's a mainly a demonstrator of GraphDB, and the source code does not seem available
